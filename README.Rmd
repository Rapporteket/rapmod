This package provides shiny application modules that may be used by registries at [Rapporteket](https://rapporteket.github.io/rapporteket/).

## Installation

You can install the development version of rapmod like so:

Install *rapmod* from CRAN:
```r
install.packages("rapmod")
```

The latest release of the package can be installed from GitHub:
```r
remotes::install_github("Rapporteket/rapmod@*release")
```

Or install the development version from GitHub with:
```r
remotes::install("Rapporteket/rapmod")
```
Alternatively, the package source code can be [cloned from GitHub](https://github.com/Rapporteket/rapmod) and built locally. 

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(rapmod)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

Please note that any changes to `README.Rmd` needs to be rendered (_e.g._ by `devtools::build_readme()`) to keep `README.md` up-to-date. To prevent commits of an outdated README-file `pre-commit.sh` in this project root can be added as a git-hook:
